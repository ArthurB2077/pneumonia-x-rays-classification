# Principal Component Analysis

## Introduction

 PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a dataset with many features into a new dataset with fewer features while retaining as much of the original information as possible.

 It does this by finding a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) axes called principal components, along which the variance of the data is maximized.

 The first principal component captures the maximum variance, the second captures the maximum remaining variance orthogonal to the first, and so on.

 PCA can be useful in cases where the original dataset has a high dimensionality or when there is multicollinearity among features.

 However, in the context of image classification with deep learning models like CNNs, PCA is generally not necessary, as these models can learn hierarchical feature representations automatically.
